Each folder should contain the following files:
* terrain.txt: Describes the terrain.
* variants.txt: Describes the variants of each terrain tile. If a given location is described in terrain but not in this file, then no variant is used.
* starts.txt: Describes starting positions of characters. Friendly characters are represented by uppercase letters, enemies by lowercase, and unoccupied titles by pound signs.
* units.txt: Maps the units described in starts.txt to a unit name, found in ../characters/
